      "resume": "I am a seasoned backend engineer with over 6 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining scalable Python-based web applications. In my current role at a fintech startup, I’ve led the development of RESTful APIs using FastAPI and Flask, managing user authentication, billing systems, and third-party integrations. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker to ensure smooth deployment across staging and production.\n\nIn 2023, I began integrating OpenAI’s GPT models into internal tools for client communication and data summarization. This included designing prompts, optimizing latency using async queues, and building a fine-tuned workflow for legal document summarization. I also collaborated with the data team to monitor model outputs and refine accuracy using evaluation datasets.\n\nI enjoy mentoring junior developers and have contributed to open-source projects related to prompt templating and API performance benchmarking. While my primary focus is backend systems, I’m passionate about the evolving LLM landscape and its applications in automation, summarization, and customer service.",
